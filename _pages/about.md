I have graduated from HKUST and received my Ph.D. degree at the end of 2023, and now I am a postdoc researcher of HKUST.
I was supervised by [Dr. Shuai Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/) during 2019-2023, and received my B.Eng. degree from Nanjing University in 2017. My research interests include binary software analysis, malware detection, vulnerability detection and software supply chain analysis.

Work Experience
------
I used to be a senior software engineer at Huawei during 2017-2018.\
During my Ph.D. program, I took my internship in 2021 in Tencent Keen Lab, and was supported by **CCF-Tencent Rhino-Bird Fund**.\
<!-- I am the leading developer for the Address Sanitizer of Huawei's [OpenArkCompiler](https://gitee.com/openarkcompiler/).
