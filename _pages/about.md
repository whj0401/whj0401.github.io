I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the CSE department supervised by [Dr. Shuai Wang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~shuaiw/). I received my Bachelor on Software Engineering degree from Nanjing University in 2017. My research interests include binary software analysis, malware detection, vulnerability detection and software supply chain analysis.
